Build on my existing project “Smart IT Copilot” (do NOT start from scratch). Your job is to extend what’s already working.

0) Ground rules

Keep the current UI layout and sidebar (Dashboard / Tickets / ServiceNow / Settings / Help).

Don’t break existing routes/pages.

Add features incrementally and keep code clean.

Keep .replit and replit.md as-is (system files). Do not rename them.

If any folder/file contains “replit” and is NOT a system file, rename it to remove “replit” (and update imports/paths).

Add clear README instructions for running locally + environment variables.

Add a .env.example and use environment variables for secrets.

Ensure everything works in Replit dev environment.

1) Add AI Chat Copilot (core feature)
Goal

Create an AI Copilot chat that helps users troubleshoot issues BEFORE creating a ticket, and also helps agents resolve tickets faster.

Requirements

Add a “Copilot Chat” panel accessible in TWO places:

A global chat page in the sidebar: Copilot Chat

Inside each ticket detail view: Ask Copilot about this ticket

Chat must support multi-turn conversation, store conversation history in the database, and be associated to:

user

optional ticket

timestamps

Output style (important)

Copilot responses must always include:

Plain-English summary

Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions (numbered steps)

What to try next if step fails

When to escalate / create ticket

Confidence score (Low/Med/High) + why

2) Add Machine Learning Triage + Continuous Learning (real ML)
Goal

Add a real ML layer that learns from historical tickets + outcomes to improve routing, priority, and troubleshooting guidance.

Requirements (MVP-Realistic)

Implement an ML pipeline using a lightweight approach (e.g., scikit-learn):

Input features: title + description + category tags + resolution notes (if available)

Baseline model: TF-IDF + linear classifier (LogReg/SVM) for:

Category prediction

Priority/urgency prediction

Add database tables for:

ml_training_examples (ticket text, labels, outcome, timestamps)

ml_model_versions (version id, trained_at, metrics, active flag)

Add endpoints:

POST /api/ml/predict → returns predicted category, priority, confidence

POST /api/ml/feedback → store whether the prediction was correct + final labels

POST /api/ml/retrain (Admin only) → trains a new model version

GET /api/ml/status → active model version + basic metrics

Add UI integration:

On ticket create/edit: show “Predicted Category/Priority (confidence)” + allow user/agent to override

On dashboard: show “Top predicted categories this week” and “Model confidence trend” (simple)

Continuous learning loop:

When a ticket is resolved, save the final category/priority + resolution outcome into training examples

Retrain manually via Admin (button) or scheduled weekly (simple cron-like approach if available)

Guardrails:

If confidence is low, Copilot should ask clarifying questions rather than guessing

Always allow human override

ML + Copilot connection

Copilot must use ML predictions to tailor troubleshooting:

If predicted category is VPN → show VPN runbook-style steps

If predicted priority is urgent → include escalation guidance and risk warnings

3) Add Knowledge Base + RAG (company knowledge grounding)
Goal

Copilot must answer using the company’s internal knowledge, not generic advice.

Requirements

Create a Knowledge Base admin page (sidebar visible to Admin only):

Upload documents: .txt, .md, .pdf (if PDF parsing is hard, allow txt/md first and stub PDF parsing)

Add/edit “articles” manually in a rich textarea

Tag articles (VPN, Email, Printer, Security, etc.)

Versioning basics: updated_at, updated_by

Implement RAG:

Store chunks + embeddings (use a simple approach supported in Replit: either local embeddings or an external embeddings API via env var)

At answer time: retrieve top relevant chunks and feed them into the chat prompt

Show “Sources” under each answer (article title + snippet)

Add a “Suggested KB Articles” widget in ticket view based on similarity.

4) Attachments in Chat (images + logs)
Goal

Users can upload screenshots/logs so Copilot can troubleshoot better.

Requirements

In chat, allow uploading:

images: png/jpg

logs/text: txt/log

Store metadata in DB and file on disk (or storage folder). Keep it simple.

For txt/log: extract text and pass into Copilot context.

For images: store image and include a note in the chat context like “User uploaded screenshot: <filename>”. If image analysis is supported via an API, add optional support controlled by env var.

Add basic safeguards:

max file size

allowed file types

5) ServiceNow Integration Upgrade (still MVP-friendly)
Goal

Make the ServiceNow page real and useful.

Requirements

On ServiceNow page:

Config form for instance URL + user + token/password (from env vars or secure storage)

“Test Connection” button

Sync options: import incidents, push ticket to ServiceNow, update status/notes

Add these actions:

“Create ServiceNow Incident” from a ticket

“Pull latest status/notes” from linked incident

“Add comment/work note” from within Smart IT Copilot

Keep it optional: the app must work without ServiceNow configured.

6) Roles + Profiles (Admin vs Agent vs End User)
Goal

Support enterprise-style role separation.

Requirements

Add user roles: admin, agent, end_user

Add a simple Users page for admins:

list users

change roles

deactivate user

In sidebar footer, show current user name + role.

Restrict:

KB management: Admin only

ServiceNow config: Admin only

Tickets: Agent + Admin

Copilot Chat: all users, but end_user should not see internal-only info

7) Settings + Help pages (real-world usable)
Settings page should include:

Profile settings (name, email, timezone)

Notification preferences (stub if needed)

Copilot preferences:

response verbosity (short/normal/detailed)

allow “auto-draft ticket” yes/no

Admin settings section:

KB refresh/reindex button

ServiceNow integration status

ML controls: retrain button + model status + last trained date

Help page should include:

What this tool does

How to use Copilot Chat

How to upload attachments safely

How ServiceNow sync works

How ML triage works + how to correct predictions (feedback loop)

FAQ + troubleshooting

“Contact admin” guidance

8) Analytics that prove ROI
Goal

Add an “AI Insights” / analytics layer that helps sell this to companies.

Requirements (MVP)

Track:

of chats
of tickets created after chat

“Deflected tickets” (user solved without creating ticket) — implement with a simple prompt at end: “Did this solve your issue? Yes/No”

Top issue categories (include predicted vs final)

Avg time to resolve (for tickets)

ML accuracy proxy: how often predicted category matched final category

Create a dashboard widget: “Estimated Cost Saved” using a configurable $/ticket value in settings.

Add export to CSV for analytics.

9) Ticket drafting + smart intake
Goal

Let Copilot convert a chat into a well-formed ticket when needed.

Requirements

Add “Create Ticket from Chat” button:

Pre-fill title, description, steps tried, device/app, impact, urgency

Include ML predictions + confidence

Add a guided intake form for end users:

pick category (and show ML suggestion)

describe symptoms

upload screenshot/log

Copilot suggests fixes first before “Submit ticket”

10) Code quality + structure

Add consistent API routes, input validation, and error handling.

Add database migrations if you already have a DB.

Add clear comments and keep naming consistent.

Add unit-test stubs if possible (optional).

11) Delivery checklist

When finished, provide:

Summary of what you changed

Where each new feature lives in the code

Exact steps to run it

All environment variables needed

Any limitations + recommended next steps for production hosting

If anything in my current code conflicts with these requirements, keep what’s already there and extend it safely without breaking existing functionality.
